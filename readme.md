# Urocyon

## Introduction

Named after a [genus of Western Hemisphere foxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urocyon), Urocyon is an intuitive and opinionated scaffolding system for your apps. Right now, it doesn't even do anything because it's not done.

## Usage

You don't actually want to use this package. It won't work for you yet.

```sh
# setup - for now...
cd /c/urocyon
pnpm link

cd /c/urocyon-cookbook
pnpm link urocyon


/c/urocyon-cookbook/node_modules/.bin/urocyon /c/all/urocyon-cookbook editorconfig
